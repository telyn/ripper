Ripper: Auto-detecting media-ripping tool
=========================================

When you put a CD or DVD containing audio or video in the main drive, hopefully it will rip it using abcde or handbrake.
Maybe there should be an option to pass the drive as a parameter for people with multiple drives.

I'll write about the internals later.
